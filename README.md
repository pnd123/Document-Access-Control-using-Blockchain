# 🔐 Web3Vault – A Decentralized Blockchain-Based File Storage Platform

A secure, privacy-first platform for encrypted file storage, sharing, and access control—powered by Web3 and IPFS.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Web3Vault** is a decentralized file storage platform built on blockchain principles, designed for privacy-focused users and developers. It allows seamless uploading, encrypted storage, and access management of files using smart contracts and IPFS. Users remain in full control of their data through wallet-based authentication and cryptographic sharing permissions.

Whether you're storing personal documents or sharing sensitive files with specific users, Web3Vault ensures tamper-proof, decentralized, and auditable access—without relying on centralized cloud providers.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- ✅ **Decentralized File Upload**  
  Upload and store files using IPFS and blockchain-based metadata for immutability and censorship resistance.

- 🔓 **Wallet-Based Access**  
  Files are viewable only when connected to the same Web3 wallet that uploaded them—no accounts, no passwords.

- 🤝 **Encrypted File Sharing**  
  Share access securely by whitelisting wallet addresses. Only authorized users can decrypt and view files.

- 🧩 **Dynamic Access Control**  
  Add or revoke address permissions in real-time. No more irreversible sharing—stay in control always.

- 🛡️ **Zero-Trust Privacy Model**  
  Even nodes storing your data can’t read it. Files are encrypted client-side before storage.
